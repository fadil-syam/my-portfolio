                hello I'm sari kusuma, a fresh computer science graduate from tech University with a passion for creating elegant solutions to complex problems. 
                my journey into coding began when I built a simple game to help my youngsters sister learn multiplication tables -- seeing her excitement as she played made me realize the power of software to make a positive impact

            <h1 class="text-xl font-bold py-5 text-sky-500">What Drives Me</h1>
            <p class="mb-3">
                I'm fascinated by the intersection of technology and education. my goal is to leverage my skills to build tools that make learning more accessible and engaging for everyone. 
                whether it's through interactive web application or applications or mobile apps, I believe technology has the potential to revolutionize how we acquire and share knowledge.
